ZTR Zeumic Work Timer, a free task logging WordPress plugin works Standalone or with Intuit QBO QuickBooks, WooCommerce, ZWM Zeumic Work Management.

== Description ==

ZTR Zeumic Work Timer is a free task logging and timing plugin that can work in tandem with WooCommerce and ZWM Zeumic Work Management to help you run your business. Using ZTR with WooCommerce requires using ZWM.

It provides a list of tasks along with the staff member who performed them and when. Tasks can be easily added and edited.

= Integration with ZWM =

When used alongside ZWM Zeumic Work Management, a button is added to start or stop timing a task from ZWM, adding it to ZTR with a single click.

When used with WooCommerce, the basic timing functionality of ZTR is linked to the management of products and orders through ZWM. In a WooCommerce website, individual products or services from orders will appear in the ZWM plugin as tasks. 

For example, a pizza order will appear as a task in the ZWM plugin. From there, ZTR can begin time tracking the preparation of that pizza. As an additional function, ZTR Pro can produce a report breaking down the time spent preparing the pizza. This gives an effective cost for a businessâ€™s traditional and mission-critical purpose of making a profit.

= Export to QuickBooks =

The list of tasks can be exported to QBO Intuit QuickBooks, allowing easy accounting and payroll management for your business.
